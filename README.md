**FLOWER FARM PRODUCT**

**Project Overview**

A client would like an IoT solution that monitors the growth process of their flower farm and eventually
gives insights of methods that can be explored in order to maximize the growth potential of their farm. In
order to achieve this the end solution needs to go through 3 phases:
1. Capturing of data during the growth process
2. Reporting
3. AI integration to give predictions and patterns
